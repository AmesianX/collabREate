  Attempt to use only native IDA api functions for user interface
  Eliminate QT specific code to make building easier

  Added primitive messaging capability in CollabREate window. Message history is
  cached in the IDB and restored with each session.

  until reconnected to the project server.

  Added more tests to narrow down the exact type being referenced when
  an operand type is changed.  Specifically enum and structure offsets.
  These changes will not fix enum and struct updates in existing project
  databases, however new enum and struct updates will be properly stored
  into those databases once you have upgraded you plugin.
